# Archie's New Home

Archie was resting, lying in bed,  
Patiently waiting till somebody said:  
“Hi little guy! Aren’t you a cutie?  
We’d like to adopt you; I think it’s our duty!”  

Archie was cautious, so timid and shy.  
Who was this person, a tear in his eye?  
The man stayed with him, the lady went out.  
She told the staff, “He’s the one, there’s no doubt!”  

Archie was happy, a much-improved mood.  
Some paperwork to sign, a new bed, some food.  
A short time later they got in the car,  
To drive to their house, it wasn’t that far.  

The cage door was opened, ready to roam.  
Welcome Archie, to your new home!
